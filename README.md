## A Little Bit of Background About Myself

## <span style="color:#de5947">Frontend Developer</span>

---

Apropos academics, I have studied **_English Linguistics_**, caught a _BA scroll_, and had a bit of experience. Yet, I found passion in **_Computer Linguistic_**; programming, and as to do what fulfills what I fell in love with, I switched to Web development, at a self-learning pace. Henceforth, I have got consumed by possibilities and have been a day-to-day software engineering fanatic. For the most part, I draft clean code on personal projects, develop software and tooling that helps people make business ideas a reality, and achieve seamless web, mobile, and 3D experiences.
